intro:
  body: >
    I'm a Research Fellow in the [Molecular and Population Genetics Team](http://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/research-divisions/division-of-genetics-and-epidemiology/molecular-and-population-genetics) at the [Institute of Cancer Research](http://www.icr.ac.uk/).
    Before this, I was a Ph.D. student in the [Structural Bioinformatics Group](http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Michael Sternberg](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.sternberg). 
    My thesis focused on understanding how protein-protein interaction networks vary between cell types and using this information to identify disease genes.
